Time is precious for human beings. An we all travel from place to place. During the travelling inorder to reach fastly at the desitination, we select Airlines as our mode of transport. 

This is an ML project to predict the airticket price and to recommend best airlines based on the user requirements. 
I developed a Artificial Neural Network for performing the price prediction. 

Also, the project helps the airline companies by analyzing the customer satisfication by doing the sentimental analysis of the treview provided by the customers. 

I developed different ML models for performing the sentimental analysis and used Google's Palm 2 LLM for doing accurate sentimental analysis and to provide a brief description of the recommended airlines. 

Cosine Similarity helped in performing the recommendation of airlines.
